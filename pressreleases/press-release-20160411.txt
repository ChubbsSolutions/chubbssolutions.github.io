Press Release

After a long and tedious investigation of the so called "embarnezzlement", the money raised was recovered and donated, as promised, to the Riley's Children Hospital.
The money was never laundered as some suspected and, as a sign of good faith, our former CTFO donated an undisclosed additional amount, from his personal funds, for the brand damages.
In the light of these events, we want to publicly make known that Chubbs Solutions has fully reinstated our CTFO back to his former position and given his deserved amount of shares.
Best,

Chubbs Public Relations
