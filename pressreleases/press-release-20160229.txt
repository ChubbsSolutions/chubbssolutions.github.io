Press Release

In light of the investigation opened against our CTFO for a case of embezzlement of $175, the executive board has decided to ask our CTFO to step down until the investigation ends.

The amount above cited was raised with the purpose of facilitating the relationship between our CTFO and our aVC's daugther, a noble cause that regrettably could not be accomplished. For this reason, the money was agreed to be sent to a children's hospital in the state of Indiana, but the money was never found.

The executive team at Chubbs Solutions would like to publicly apologize to our donators, who have sacrificed a lot to make this fundraiser possible. The team is also taking steps to correct this wrong and to make sure a situation like this never takes place in the future.

We would also like to deny the comments from certain individuals regarding the case of gender discrimination in our executive voting process and the accusation of bribery in the selection process of new members. We have no further comments on this regard.

Have a nice day, bitches.
